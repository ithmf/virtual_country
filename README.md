We have to form our own virtual country. We have a large number of people with a large
area.

If we do farming as a government, we will have to give fixed wages to the farmers and
this will be a less effective method. If we tell them that this farm is theirs, whatever
grows will be theirs and they will use it only for farming then it will be more efficient. No
salary will have to be paid. There will be less utilization of resources. The government
will have to regulate the market. Pesticides and seeds will be made available at low
prices.

Roads and railways will be developed to transport things and people.

If the government builds a road then whoever has more money will do business from
the shop. Those who have less money will trade on the street. The area will develop
gradually..

Then the government acquires the area and starts developing it. The area will be divided
mainly into industrial, commercial, residential type. Each type has its own benefits. People
buy property according to their wealth. Then people in rural areas or less wealthy people
provide better structure to the area by doing the main work of building construction. Then
people will earn money by creating jobs or businesses and will boost the economy. people
will go Better place for find better opportunity.

The region is mainly divided into urban, semi-urban and rural parts.

We will create education policy for our country children. If a person knows about only one
skill. They will do the same thing all their life even if the benefits are less. We have to teach
multiple subjects. if children will achieve good marks then they will easily adapt to new
environment and find best job fit for him and their new family.

Skills are more important in life. If you have the right and unique skills you will earn more
and live a happy life. No one teaches everything to everyone. If everyone learned a skill. It
will become common and lose its importance. No one will pay you more for general skills.

All are depend on demand and supply.

Most people like to fool other people. They'll be glad to have someone dumber than them.

All are not the same. They would gather in groups and start a topic about popular things
and collect some information about person interest. And create a fake environment that
doesn't exist. and then they will use that person. Some people would be happy to have
someone more powerful and intelligent than them. to become better.

People will collect things and memories that make them feel happy. People share
information in their networks. If you are not connected to a network you will not be able to
collect the necessary information about anything.

Languages, words, slogans, music and stories are created by people for many purpose. The
story and music are next level. People create or share stories for their own ulterior motives.

The majority shares the beneficiary side with all. They use stories for their own good. No
one listens to minority people as if they do not exist.

We have education. There is nothing in the structure of the building that protects us from
weather, temperature, wild animals, insects. This will prevent interference from other
people.

If we send a computer to someone. Then whoever gets the computer will use it. People who
don't know the computer has been shipped won't do anything because they don't know
anything. People who know that computers have been shipped will use their networks to
bring more computers to their home. Some people find disadvantages in computers and
how to misuse it. Then everyone will get bored or if new technology comes then they will
send their computers to such a place where people will not know about computers or they
will not have computers. 

If the poor asks for clothes, we will ask the capitalists to make clothes, then they will make the clothes and send them to the market. In the end, all the clothes are kept in the shop but never reach the poor people. Clothes are information.
People share information about something with another person. If
the other person finds any unique information then they will share it with their network,
which will benefit them in the future. it is like bank. bank give you money if you double the
money bank will give you more money.

If we guide someone, he will guide 30 people. Similarly, If we missguided someone, he will
missguided 30 people. This will create diverse people in the society. Some people know
how the world works and others don't. Some people will give instructions. Some people will
follow instructions. Some people do not follow instructions. Some people will watch
everything from a distance like spectators.

People do not commit any crime where information about what is on the crime list is
shared. Where information is not shared. People use this crime list to mislead people into
committing.

As people come to know how life is, they come to school to guide people like them and tell
them how life is. Your life won't be as good if you don't do anything.
